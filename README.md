Materials for the hands-on Lean session during the [Combinatorial Coworkspace 2024](https://www.combinatorial-cowork.space/)


## Abstract

[Lean](https://lean-lang.org/) is a language based on [dependent type theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_type), which can be used to express formal proofs. Its most extensive mathematical library, [mathlib](https://leanprover-community.github.io/index.html), contains many theorems and definitions and theorems from various areas of math.

The plan for this hands-on session:

- Understand why it might be beneficial to use a theorem prover and how it works.
- Demo the current capabilities of Lean/mathlib and its ecosystem.
- Get you hands dirty by trying it out yourself: you'll have the opportunity to prove a lemma!

## Prerequisites

We don't assume any familiarity with Lean/mathlib.
However, you will need some way to run Lean on your computer.
There are different options:

 - *The best way*: [Install lean on your computer](https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html)
 - *The fast way*: [Try lean online](https://live.lean-lang.org/)
 - *Another way*: [Use gitpod](https://gitpod.io/new/#/https://github.com/mo271/MathlibSynergies)

 If you are new to Lean/mathlib, a fun way to begin is by playing the [the natural number game](https://adam.math.hhu.de/)!
